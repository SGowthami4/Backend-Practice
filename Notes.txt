//What is HTTP?
- HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol.It is the foundation of the internet and how it functions and exchanges data.
- HTTP works in a Request and Response system .The client requests a specific resource from the server, and if the resource is available, it will be returned in a response from the server.
-The server returns a status code in it's response to let the client know if the rquest was successful or not.
- Status codes are grouped into different numbers each indicating different response types.For example, codes 200-299 mean successful, and codes 300-399 indicate redirection.
HTTP Status codes
- 1XX-Informational
- 2XX- success(Ex:200(ok) successful with no problems)
- 3XX- redirection
- 4XX- Client Error (Ex:404(File not found -resource was not located by the server))
- 5XX- Server Error

- When you load a web page in your browser, the requests are sent to the corresponding server to fetch the various components of the page .Each request returns an individual response.

Features of HTTP:
 - HTTP has many features that make it the most widespread transfer protocol. HTTP is an application layer protocol based on TCP, a secure transport layer protocol.
 - HTTP is also stateless, meaning each request and response cycle is separate from the ones before and after.
 - HTTP also enables the use of HTTP Headers in requests and responses, which allow them to be customized and provide extra information.
 - HTTP also has a secure version-HTTPS - the standard network conection on the internet.
  
//The Anatomy of HTTP Requests:
- HTTP Requests typically contain three things: 1.a request line, 
                                                2.header fields, and
                                                3. a body(This one is optional).

1.The Request line-The request line is made up of 3 parts
   - Firstly , the HTTP Method,such as GET,POST, or DELETE. 
   - Secondly, the resource URL. This locates the requested resource on the server.
   - Thirdly, the current HTTP version. 
  - The request line is like the foundation of a request, like a pizza base.

2. Header Fields:These provide extra information to the server about the request.
   There are many different Headers.
   For example - Content-type, which indicates the data format.
               - Content-length indicates the length of the data in bytes.
               - Accept-Language indicates the Language of the content accepted by the client.

3.Body(data)- The last part of the request is the body(data).This part is usually only needed
if the HTTP method is POST,PUT, or PATCH because it contains the new data being sent to the server.
For Ex:In a POST request, the body could contain the details of a pizza oder form.

the structure of an HTTP request in full:
First, there's a request line that contains the HTTP Method, resource URL, and current HTTP version.
Secondly, the HTTP Header fields provide extra information about the request. If the request is GET, this is all the information needed.
 However, if the request is POST, PUT, or PATCH, there is a body containing a message. An empty line always separates the Headers and the body.

//Anatomy of an HTTP Response :
HTTP responses are made by a server in response to a client's request.They inform the client about whether the request was
successful; if not, they provide error information. They also deliver resources to te client if that's what is requested.
resources to the client if that's what is requested. There are three components o an HTTP response.
